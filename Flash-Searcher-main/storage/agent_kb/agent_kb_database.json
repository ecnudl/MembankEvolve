    "question": "In which year did the author of 'The Great Gatsby' die? Please search for the answer and provide only the year as a 4-digit number.",
    "agent_planning": "1. Problem decomposition was executed hierarchically: first isolating the author identity as a prerequisite sub-goal, then treating the death year as a dependent biographical fact—ensuring logical dependency resolution before proceeding. 2. Tool selection was deliberately minimal and parallelized: two simultaneous web searches (‘author of The Great Gatsby’ and ‘F. Scott Fitzgerald death year’) were chosen over sequential or multi-hop crawling because prior domain knowledge indicated high-confidence, unambiguous answers would appear in top search results from authoritative sources (e.g., Wikipedia, Britannica, NYT obituaries), making iterative refinement unnecessary. 3. The plan explicitly included redundant verification paths (e.g., Path 2.2 and 2.3) but pragmatically collapsed them upon observing consistent, cross-validated evidence (1940 appearing in Wikipedia, NYT, NJ Hall of Fame, and historical society pages), demonstrating adaptive confidence-based termination rather than rigid adherence to all planned paths.",
    "search_agent_planning": "Query formulation used precise, noun-phrase–driven patterns optimized for factual retrieval: ‘author of The Great Gatsby’ leveraged canonical title formatting (exact match + definite article) to suppress irrelevant creative interpretations, while ‘F. Scott Fitzgerald death year’ employed entity-first syntax with attribute focus to trigger knowledge-graph–enhanced SERP features (e.g., answer boxes, date-rich snippets). Source prioritization applied a tiered credibility heuristic: Wikipedia was accepted as primary *only* when corroborated by at least two independent high-authority domains (e.g., NYT obituary + NJ Hall of Fame), and temporal consistency across sources (all citing Dec 21, 1940) served as implicit validation—eliminating need for manual date parsing or disambiguation. Information extraction focused exclusively on structured date fragments (‘1896–1940’, ‘Died: Dec. 21, 1940’, ‘died in 1940’) and ignored narrative context, enabling deterministic year extraction without NLP ambiguity.",
    "agent_experience": "Key lessons include: (a) For well-documented literary figures, biographical facts are highly convergent across top-tier sources—so parallel dual-query execution reduces latency without compromising accuracy; (b) Success hinges on recognizing when evidence saturation occurs (here, 5/5 search results for death year uniformly cited 1940 across diverse domains), allowing early termination of the planning loop; and (c) Avoiding over-engineering—no crawling, no citation analysis, and no fallback to low-precision tools (e.g., general QA models) was needed because the task mapped cleanly to search-indexed, consensus-verified facts. Best practice is to treat ‘famous person + attribute’ queries as solved problems requiring only query precision and cross-source confirmation—not deep reasoning.",
    "search_agent_experience": "Effective query patterns consistently use [Entity] + [Attribute] syntax (e.g., ‘F. Scott Fitzgerald death year’) rather than question-form phrasing (e.g., ‘When did F. Scott Fitzgerald die?’), which better aligns with search engine knowledge-graph indexing. Reliable source types follow a strict hierarchy: Wikipedia (for initial entity resolution) → primary archival sources (NYT obituaries, official hall-of-fame entries) → educational/institutional domains (britannica.com, library.gov)—with social media or blog posts treated solely as corroborative signals, never primary evidence. Validation is performed via pattern convergence: identical year values appearing in ≥3 independent sources with distinct publication authorities (e.g., encyclopedia, newspaper archive, state hall of fame) constitute sufficient proof; no manual date arithmetic or source pedigree scoring is required. Data processing applies strict lexical filtering—extracting only 4-digit numeric strings adjacent to death-related tokens (‘died’, ‘death’, ‘–’, ‘(aged’) and rejecting all non-numeric variants (e.g., ‘forty-four’, ‘mid-1940s’).",

    "question": "What is the atomic number of the chemical element that has the symbol 'Fe'? First, identify what element 'Fe' represents, then find its atomic number.",
    "agent_planning": "1. Decompose the task into two hierarchically dependent atomic goals: (a) symbol-to-element-name resolution and (b) element-to-atomic-number retrieval—enforcing strict logical ordering to prevent premature attribute assignment. 2. Design parallelizable, convergent paths for each goal: for Goal 1, use both direct ('Fe element name') and contextual ('Fe periodic table') queries; for Goal 2, execute *four* complementary searches ('Fe atomic number', 'iron atomic number', 'Fe Z=', and 'Fe element name') to exploit lexical redundancy and cross-domain signal alignment. 3. Embed adaptive termination criteria directly into the plan: require exact integer agreement across ≥3 independent authoritative sources (e.g., Wikipedia, PubChem, RSC Periodic Table) *and* confirm lexical consistency between symbol ('Fe'), name ('iron'), and atomic number ('26') before final answer issuance—eliminating sequential fallbacks or unnecessary crawling unless consensus fails.",
    "search_agent_planning": "Query formulation prioritizes canonical scientific phrasing over natural language paraphrasing: 'Fe atomic number' (not 'what is the number for Fe?') and 'Fe Z=' (leveraging standard notation) maximize precision in chemistry-specific search engines and knowledge graphs. Source prioritization applies a tiered credibility filter: top-tier domains (iupac.org, nist.gov, rsc.org, pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) are implicitly targeted via query semantics—even without explicit URL constraints—because authoritative chemistry sources dominate SERPs for such well-defined queries. Information extraction focuses on lexical proximity patterns: extract integers immediately adjacent to unambiguous markers like 'atomic number', 'Z=', or 'proton number', while applying strict syntactic filters to reject non-numeric variants (e.g., 'twenty-six', '≈26', '26.0'). Validation is performed via cross-query convergence: if 'Fe atomic number', 'iron atomic number', and 'Fe element name' all surface '26' and 'iron' in overlapping top-result snippets—especially within the same document (e.g., Wikipedia’s lead sentence)—confidence is deemed sufficient for immediate termination without crawling.",
    "agent_experience": "Treating elemental symbol–name–atomic number mappings as *canonical solved problems*—rather than open-ended reasoning tasks—dramatically improves reliability: the agent avoids error-prone chain-of-thought inference by delegating resolution entirely to authoritative, high-consensus external sources. Crucially, the agent learned that hierarchical dependency (symbol → name → atomic number) must be *logically enforced in planning* but *operationally bypassed in execution*: parallel queries like 'Fe atomic number' yield faster, more robust answers than sequential lookups because chemistry databases embed this relationship natively in structured metadata. Furthermore, early termination based on multi-source numeric convergence (e.g., '26' appearing identically in Wikipedia, PubChem, and RSC) proved more efficient and accurate than exhaustive crawling—validating the principle that for IUPAC-standardized facts, consensus across ≥3 independent high-trust domains constitutes definitive ground truth.",
    "search_agent_experience": "Effective query patterns follow the 'entity + canonical attribute' template: 'Fe atomic number' outperformed 'what is Fe's atomic number?' by reducing ambiguity and increasing snippet relevance; adding notation-based variants like 'Fe Z=' served as orthogonal validation—though required filtering out video-game false positives (e.g., 'Fez'), reinforcing the need for domain-aware query disambiguation. Reliable source types were empirically identified as those with structured data presentation: PubChem’s /element/Iron page, RSC’s periodic-table.rsc.org/element/26/iron, and Wikipedia’s lead paragraph consistently place atomic number as an unambiguous integer in the first sentence or property table—enabling zero-click extraction. Information validation relied on *pattern convergence*, not source count alone: when '26' appeared adjacent to 'atomic number' in three distinct contexts (Wikipedia lead, RSC property row, ASBMB article title 'atomic No. 26'), and simultaneously co-occurred with 'iron' in all four query sets, confidence thresholds were met—demonstrating that lexical co-location + numeric exactness + cross-query replication is more robust than isolated source verification.",

    "question": "How many countries border France? Please search for this information and count all countries that share a land border with France (not including overseas territories).",
    "agent_planning": "1. The agent decomposed the task into two atomic, sequentially dependent goals: (a) enumerating sovereign states with land borders to *metropolitan France* (explicitly excluding overseas territories), and (b) validating land-border sovereignty—especially for microstates like Monaco—using treaty-based and administrative evidence. 2. Tool selection was strategically tiered: parallel web searches targeted lexically distinct, high-precision queries ('countries bordering metropolitan France', 'land borders of France map', 'France adjacent countries list') to exploit complementary indexing signals (geopolitical databases, cartographic sources, encyclopedic summaries), while crawl operations were reserved for authoritative primary sources (diplomatie.gouv.fr, CIA World Factbook) to resolve ambiguity around Monaco’s status and overseas inclusion. 3. Decision-making prioritized consensus validation over exhaustive enumeration: the plan mandated agreement across ≥2 high-authority sources on both *count* and *exact country names*, with explicit termination logic triggered upon convergence on eight sovereign states—including Monaco—verified via sovereign-status cross-checks (ISO 3166-1/UN M49) and treaty documentation (e.g., 1861 Franco-Monegasque Treaty).",
    "search_agent_planning": "The search strategy employed three complementary query types: (i) semantic-constrained queries ('metropolitan France') to filter out overseas territories at the retrieval layer; (ii) cartographic intent queries ('land borders of France map') to surface authoritative boundary visualizations (e.g., IGN, EU NUTS datasets) enabling geographic contiguity verification; and (iii) structured-list queries ('France adjacent countries list') optimized for extraction from property tables or infoboxes in high-trust domains (Wikipedia geography pages, Britannica, Nations Online). Source prioritization followed a strict hierarchy: official government portals (diplomatie.gouv.fr) and intergovernmental references (CIA World Factbook, INSEE) were treated as gold-standard validators, while secondary sources (World Atlas, Expatica) served as consensus anchors only when explicitly qualifying 'metropolitan' or 'mainland' scope. Information extraction focused on lead paragraphs, data tables, and boundary-length annotations (e.g., 'Monaco 4 km') to confirm land adjacency and exclude maritime-only interfaces; validation required identical country names appearing in ≥3 independent high-trust domains before final enumeration.",
    "agent_experience": "Key lessons include: (1) Microstate inclusion (e.g., Monaco) cannot be assumed from list count alone—it requires *treaty-level verification* of land contiguity, not just diplomatic recognition; (2) Parallel, lexically diverse queries significantly reduce false negatives caused by source-specific phrasing (e.g., 'adjacent countries' vs. 'bordering countries' vs. 'land boundaries'); and (3) Early termination is safe and efficient when ≥2 authoritative sources converge on identical enumerated lists *and* all candidates pass sovereign-status filtering (e.g., UN M49 membership, absence from 'dependencies' sections). Best practices discovered include anchoring validation to *quantitative boundary metrics* (e.g., 'Monaco 4 km') as objective proxies for land-border existence, and preemptively excluding ambiguous sources (e.g., YouTube/TikTok) unless they cite verifiable primary data. Error avoidance centered on rejecting any count that conflates metropolitan and overseas borders—a failure mode observed in Reddit and social media results referencing French Guiana’s borders with Brazil/Suriname.",
    "search_agent_experience": "Effective query patterns consistently embedded *geopolitical scoping modifiers*: 'metropolitan France', 'European France', or 'mainland France'—not just 'France'—to suppress overseas territory noise in top results. Reliable source types fell into three tiers: Tier 1 (definitive) included official French government portals (diplomatie.gouv.fr), the CIA World Factbook's 'Land boundaries' field, and Wikipedia's 'Borders of France' page (which explicitly separates metropolitan vs. overseas borders); Tier 2 (consensus anchors) comprised World Atlas, Expatica, and Nations Online Project due to their consistent use of verified boundary-length data; Tier 3 (contextual) included maps-france.com and political map repositories for visual adjacency confirmation. Information validation relied on *triangulation of quantitative attributes*: matching country names *and* cited border lengths (e.g., 'Luxembourg 73 km') across ≥2 sources provided stronger evidence than name-only agreement. Data processing prioritized extraction from structured fields (tables, bullet lists, infoboxes) over prose, and discarded any result mentioning '11 countries' unless it explicitly attributed the extra count to overseas departments—a critical filter that prevented conflation of administrative jurisdiction with physical land adjacency.",
