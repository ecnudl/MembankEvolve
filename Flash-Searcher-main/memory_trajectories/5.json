Then, use the crawl_page tool to extract the distance in kilometers from the structured section on the Wikipedia page, ensuring it represents the minimum perigee.\n  - Success: The distance must be clearly labeled in kilometers and validated against infobox and main textual content consistency.\n- Path 1.2: Verify Against Authoritative References\n  - Approach: Identify and cross-verify the retrieved minimum perigee value with authoritative sources like NASA or JPL DE440 by performing supplementary web searches.\n  - Success: Verification with at least two independent authoritative sources confirms the minimum perigee distance in kilometers.\n\n## Goal 2: Extract Eliud Kipchoge’s Official Marathon Record Pace\n- Path 2.1: Retrieve Official Pace from World Athletics\n  - Approach: Conduct a web search using \"Eliud Kipchoge marathon record pace official site:worldathletics.org\". Use the crawl_page tool to verify and convert the pace (2:01:09) to km/h.\n  - Success: Pace conversion to km/h accurately reflects 20.91 km/h based on 42.195 km divided by 2.0175 hours.\n- Path 2.2: Cross-Validation with Other Authoritative Sources\n  - Approach: Search and cross-reference Kipchoge’s official marathon details with other major marathons’ IAAF-certified paces.\n  - Success: At least two authoritative records yield consistent pace conversion results in km/h.\n\n## Goal 3: Compute Time Using Distance and Pace\n- Path 3.1: Unit-Consistent Calculation\n  - Approach: Calculate time as distance (in km) divided by speed (in km/h), performing checks throughout for unit consistency. Convert the result to hours and then round to the nearest thousand hours.\n  - Success: The final number of hours is an integer rounded to the nearest thousand with appropriate unit verification.\n- Path 3.2: Validation via Cross-Calculation\n  - Approach: Recompute using alternative authoritative data sources to confirm initial results are consistent with independently sourced values.\n  - Success: Independent calculations corroborate the initial rounded figure, confirming accuracy in terms of distance, pace, and duration.",

To break down this pace into kilometers per hour:\n\n- Kipchoge’s full marathon time of 2:01:09 translates into 121.1 minutes or approximately 725 seconds for 42.195 kilometers.\n- To calculate his average speed, divide the marathon distance (42.195 km) by the time taken in hours (2.018 hours):\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Pace} = \\frac{42.195 \\, \\text{km}}{2.018 \\, \\text{hours}} \\approx 20.9 \\, \\text{km/h} \\]\n\nKipchoge maintained speeds that projected a sub-two-hour finish initially, passing through 5km in 14:14, translating to \\( \\approx 21.0 \\, \\text{km/h} \\), and 10km in 28:22, indicating \\( \\approx 21.1 \\, \\text{km/h} \\).\n\nThus, Eliud Kipchoge’s marathon pace during his world record-setting run in Berlin can be approximated at 20.9 km/h overall for the entire race."
