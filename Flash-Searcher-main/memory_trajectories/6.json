It outlines the available titles under various categories like DVD, Blu-Ray, and Video Games, along with their genres, release years, and status (e.g., Available, Rented, Missing, or Overdue). The question asked specifically about the Blu-Ray entries, which were detailed only by title and release year, along with their status.
