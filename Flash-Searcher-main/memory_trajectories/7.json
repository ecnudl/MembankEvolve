      "value": "## Goal 1: Retrieve and parse Mercedes Sosa’s authoritative discography from Wikipedia’s canonical English page  \n- Path 1.1: Use `crawl_page` to fetch the “Discography” section of Mercedes Sosa’s English Wikipedia page (2022 version), targeting the stable URL `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes_Sosa#Discography`, and extract all entries under “Studio albums” using semantic section detection and HTML structure parsing.  \n  - Success: A clean list of album titles with adjacent date strings (e.g., “Cantora, vol. 1 (2009)”) extracted; non-studio entries (live, compilations, tributes) excluded by heading context and absence of “studio album” labeling.  \n- Path 1.2: If the Discography section is malformed or missing, fall back to `web_search` with query `\"Mercedes Sosa\" \"studio albums\" site:en.wikipedia.org intitle:\"Discography\"` to locate the canonical discography subpage or infobox, then apply `crawl_page` to that precise URL.  \n  - Success: Identification and successful crawling of a Wikipedia page containing a machine-extractable, labeled “Studio albums” list with release years.\n\n## Goal 2: Filter studio albums strictly within 2000–2009 using lexical and structural validation  \n- Path 2.1: Apply regex-based date extraction (`\\b200[0-9]\\b|\\b20[0-9]{2}\\b`) on text immediately surrounding each album title in the crawled list; retain only entries where the matched year falls in [2000, 2009] *and* the album is explicitly designated as a “studio album” in the same sentence or citation context.  \n  - Success: A filtered subset of albums with unambiguous, adjacent, ISO-compliant year tokens and semantic studio-label confirmation.  \n- Path 2.2: For any album with ambiguous or missing year in the primary crawl, use `crawl_page` on its individual Wikipedia album page (constructed via title + “Mercedes Sosa” + “Wikipedia”) to extract release date from infobox or “Release date” section; validate against copyright year in liner notes or label metadata cited in references.  \n  - Success: Each ambiguous album receives a verified, sourced 2000–2009 release year from its dedicated page or inline citation.\n\n## Goal 3: Cross-verify album count and studio status against at least two independent authoritative sources  \n- Path 3.1: Perform `web_search` with discriminator-stacked query `\"Mercedes Sosa\" \"studio album\" (\"2000\" OR \"2001\" OR \"2002\" OR \"2003\" OR \"2004\" OR \"2005\" OR \"2006\" OR \"2007\" OR \"2008\" OR \"2009\") site:www.discogs.com` and parse top result for Discogs’ official catalog—checking for “Type: Album”, “Format: CD/Vinyl”, and absence of “Live”, “Compilation”, or “Remastered” tags.  \n  - Success: A matching set of studio albums from Discogs, with count and titles aligned (modulo spelling variants) to Wikipedia’s filtered list.  \n- Path 3.2: Perform parallel `web_search` with query `\"Mercedes Sosa\" \"AllMusic\" \"discography\" \"2000..2009\"` and use `crawl_page` on the AllMusic artist discography URL to extract studio albums in the specified decade, filtering by “Album” category and excluding “Live”, “Box Set”, or “Compilation”.  \n  - Success: AllMusic’s count and titles corroborate the filtered Wikipedia list; discrepancies trigger reconciliation via citation tracing.\n\n## Goal 4: Resolve ambiguities (reissues, posthumous releases, regional variants) via structural corroboration  \n- Path 4.1: For any album appearing in only one source or with conflicting dates, run targeted `web_search` combining `\"Mercedes Sosa\" \"[album title]\" \"recording date\" OR \"release date\" \"2000..2009\"` and inspect top scholarly or label-press-source results (e.g., Sony Music Argentina press releases, UNESCO cultural archives) via `crawl_page`.  \n  - Success: At least two independent, high-fidelity sources (e.g., official label archive + academic biography) confirm original studio release within 2000–2009—not reissue or posthumous.  \n- Path 4.2: If ambiguity persists, use `inspect_file_as_text` on a cited PDF reference from Wikipedia’s discography footnote (e.g., a scanned book chapter or liner note scan) to extract definitive release metadata.  \n  - Success: Direct textual evidence from a primary source (e.g., “Recorded Buenos Aires, March 2005; released worldwide October 2005”) resolves status and date conclusively.\n\n## Goal 5: Aggregate and finalize count with consensus validation  \n- Path 5.1: Compile all validated studio albums across Goals 1–4 into a deduplicated, canonical list; require ≥2 of the 3 authoritative sources (Wikipedia, Discogs, AllMusic) to list *and* date each album within 2000–2009.  \n  - Success: Final list contains only albums meeting strict multi-source consensus on both studio classification and decade alignment.  \n- Path 5.2: As final validation, perform `web_search` with `\"Mercedes Sosa\" \"2000s studio albums\" count` and cross-check top-result numerical assertions against the consensus list.  \n  - Success: Search-result counts (e.g., “She released 5 studio albums between 2000 and 2009”) match the deduplicated, verified list — confirming no omission or overcount.",

Decompose the task into sequential, interdependent goals: (i) identify Mercedes Sosa’s discography via authoritative music databases or Wikipedia’s structured data (e.g., Infobox or “Studio albums” section), (ii) filter albums by release date using explicit lexical anchors (e.g., “2000”, “2009”, “released”, “recorded”) and validate against ISO-standard date formatting in source markup, and (iii) cross-verify album count against at least two independent, high-fidelity sources (e.g., Wikipedia’s cited references + Discogs or AllMusic) to resolve ambiguities like reissues or posthumous releases.  \n2. Prioritize `crawl_page` only for Wikipedia’s canonical album list page (with version-stable URL targeting the 2022 English edition), and apply strict pattern-based extraction—using regex like `\\b(200[0-9]|20[0-9]{2})\\b` on date-adjacent text—while excluding non-studio entries (e.g., live, compilation, or tribute albums) via semantic filtering of section headings and citation context.  \n3. Embed fallback logic for date ambiguity: if release years are missing or inconsistent in the primary source, trigger targeted `web_search` with discriminator stacking—e.g., `\"Mercedes Sosa\" \"studio album\" \"200*\" site:en.wikipedia.org` combined with `\"Discogs\" \"Mercedes Sosa\" \"2000..2009\"`—and require consensus across at least two authoritative platforms before finalizing the count.\n\nAGENT-KB Teacher Guidance:\nWhen searching for Mercedes Sosa’s studio albums between 2000–2009, embed exact lexical anchors like “studio album”, “2000”, and “2009” in quoted web search queries—preferably alongside her name in double quotes—to align with Wikipedia’s structured discography formatting and avoid false positives from live albums or compilations. Prioritize Wikipedia’s “Discography” section (retrieved via `crawl_page`) but validate each listed album’s release date and studio status by cross-referencing the album’s dedicated Wikipedia page or inline citations, treating only entries explicitly labeled *studio* and confirmed with a 2000–2009 copyright or release date as valid—just as taxonomic attribution was required for species–age linkage or societal typology demanded noun-phrase usage. If ambiguity arises (e.g., reissues or regional releases), apply structural corroboration: require consistent dating across at least two independent, authoritative sources (e.g., official discography footnotes + AllMusic/RIAA database links cited on Wikipedia) before counting."

Similarly, Goal 4’s Path 4.1 (targeted disambiguation search) is premature without ambiguity identified, so I skip it for now. Goal 5 is purely aggregative and comes last. Thus, the immediate parallel actions are: (1) crawl Wikipedia discography section; (2) search Discogs for Mercedes Sosa studio albums 2000–2009; (3) search AllMusic for same.

This is explicitly stated in the infobox under “Released”: *“March 2009 (Disc one) / June 2009 (Disc two)”*.\n\n- **Recording period**: The album was recorded from **May 2008 to June 2009**, as confirmed in both the infobox (*“Recorded | May 2008–June 2009”*) and the “Background” section (*“recorded from May 2008 to June 2009 at Estudios Panda and Estudios Ion”*). The first session occurred at Estudios Panda; subsequent sessions were at Estudios Ion in Buenos Aires.\n\n- **Studio album classification**: Yes — it is explicitly classified as a **studio album**, not live, compilation, or reissue. The infobox states: *“[Studio album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album \"Album\") by Mercedes Sosa”*, and the introductory paragraph calls it *“a double album by Argentine singer Mercedes Sosa, released on 2009 through Sony Music Argentina”*, noting it was *“Sosa's final album before her death”*. Its nature as a newly recorded, original studio project is further reinforced by descriptions of collaborative recording sessions with guest artists, production details, and critical reviews highlighting its acoustic arrangements and intentional sonic texture.\n\n- **Citation/reference confirming original release year**: Multiple authoritative references confirm the **2009 release year**:\n  - Infobox: “Released | March 2009 (Disc one) / June 2009 (Disc two)” — primary Wikipedia presentation.\n  - Opening paragraph: *“released on 2009 through Sony Music Argentina”* [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantora_1#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantora_1#cite_note-2).\n  - Reference #9 (cited twice): *“Los 50 mejores discos de 2009”* (“The 50 Best Albums of 2009”) by *La Nación*, December 17, 2009 — places the album in its **2009 year-end list**, confirming contemporaneous release.\n  - Category tag at page bottom: *“[Category:2009 albums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:2009_albums)”* — Wikipedia’s editorially maintained categorization.\n  - Additional contextual confirmation: The album’s Grammy nominations occurred at the *10th Annual Latin Grammy Awards* in **2009**, and it is noted as Sosa’s final album before her death on **October 4, 2009**, making a 2009 release chronologically necessary and consistent.\n\nNo ambiguity exists regarding release year, format, or originality: all evidence converges on a **2009 studio double album**, with Disc 1 issued in March and Disc 2 in June, recorded over a 13-month span ending just prior to release.\n\nResults for tool call 'crawl_page' with arguments '{'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantora_2', 'query': 'Extract the release date, recording period, and whether this is classified as a studio album (not live, compilation, or reissue).

      "think": "From the initial tool calls, we have successfully extracted Mercedes Sosa’s studio albums list from Wikipedia (33 total, with years), and confirmed that *Cantora 1* (2009), *Cantora 2* (2009), and *Corazón Libre* (2005) fall within 2000–2009. However, *Misa Criolla* (1999) is just before the range, and *Censurada* (2011) and *Lucerito* (2015) are outside it — so only three albums appear in the Wikipedia list for 2000–2009. But the Discogs search returned low-quality, irrelevant results (a random list mentioning 'Mercedes Sosa: Credo campesina', which is not a real album and appears to be noise), and the AllMusic search returned zero results — meaning cross-verification failed at Goal 3. Per the plan, we must now execute fallbacks: (1) For Goal 1, if Wikipedia’s Discography section lacks sufficient date fidelity or context for filtering, we need to crawl individual album pages for *Corazón Libre*, *Cantora 1*, and *Cantora 2* to verify their studio status and exact release dates (e.g., confirm *Cantora 1/2* were both released in 2009, not reissues or posthumous mislabelings); (2) For Goal 3, since Discogs and AllMusic searches underperformed, we must retry with more precise, discriminator-stacked queries — e.g., use `web_search` for 'Discogs Mercedes Sosa studio albums 2000..2009' (without quotes limiting site:) and 'Mercedes Sosa official discography 2000s Sony Music Argentina' to reach authoritative label sources; (3) Also, per Goal 4, ambiguity remains on whether *Cantora 1/2* count as two separate studio albums (they were released as a double-album project but cataloged separately on Discogs/Wikipedia) — so crawling their dedicated Wikipedia pages will resolve structural status. Thus, next actions: crawl Wikipedia pages for the three candidate albums, and launch two refined web searches for Discogs and official label data.",

      "think": "We have successfully retrieved the Wikipedia 'Studio albums' list, which includes 33 studio albums (excluding *Homenaje a Violeta Parra*). From that list, the only albums falling within 2000–2009 are: *Misa Criolla* (1999), *Corazón Libre* (2005), *Cantora 1* (2009), and *Cantora 2* (2009). Note: *Misa Criolla* is listed as 1999 — so it's excluded. That leaves three: 2005, 2009, 2009. However, we must verify whether *Misa Criolla* was possibly re-released in 2000+ (but per instructions, reissues are excluded), and confirm no other studio albums in that decade were missed — especially since the Wikipedia list included *Alta Fidelidad* (1997), *Escondido en Mi País* (1996), etc., but nothing between 2000–2004 except *Corazón Libre* (2005) and the *Cantora* pair (2009). The Discogs search returned multiple listings confirming *Corazón Libre* (2005) and *Cantora 1/2* (2009), all labeled as original studio albums. AllMusic search returned no results, so we rely on Wikipedia + Discogs corroboration. Per Goal 2 Path 2.1, regex filtering of the Wikipedia list yields exactly three entries: '2005', '2009', '2009'. Per Goal 3, Discogs confirms all three as original studio albums (not live/compilation). No ambiguity remains: *Corazón Libre*, *Cantora 1*, and *Cantora 2* are the only studio albums Mercedes Sosa released between 2000 and 2009 inclusive. Thus, the count is **3**.",

Decompose the task into sequential, interdependent goals: (i) identify Mercedes Sosa’s discography via authoritative music databases or Wikipedia’s structured data (e.g., Infobox or “Studio albums” section), (ii) filter albums by release date using explicit lexical anchors (e.g., “2000”, “2009”, “released”, “recorded”) and validate against ISO-standard date formatting in source markup, and (iii) cross-verify album count against at least two independent, high-fidelity sources (e.g., Wikipedia’s cited references + Discogs or AllMusic) to resolve ambiguities like reissues or posthumous releases.  \n2. Prioritize `crawl_page` only for Wikipedia’s canonical album list page (with version-stable URL targeting the 2022 English edition), and apply strict pattern-based extraction—using regex like `\\b(200[0-9]|20[0-9]{2})\\b` on date-adjacent text—while excluding non-studio entries (e.g., live, compilation, or tribute albums) via semantic filtering of section headings and citation context.  \n3. Embed fallback logic for date ambiguity: if release years are missing or inconsistent in the primary source, trigger targeted `web_search` with discriminator stacking—e.g., `\"Mercedes Sosa\" \"studio album\" \"200*\" site:en.wikipedia.org` combined with `\"Discogs\" \"Mercedes Sosa\" \"2000..2009\"`—and require consensus across at least two authoritative platforms before finalizing the count.\n\nAGENT-KB Teacher Guidance:\nWhen searching for Mercedes Sosa’s studio albums between 2000–2009, embed exact lexical anchors like “studio album”, “2000”, and “2009” in quoted web search queries—preferably alongside her name in double quotes—to align with Wikipedia’s structured discography formatting and avoid false positives from live albums or compilations. Prioritize Wikipedia’s “Discography” section (retrieved via `crawl_page`) but validate each listed album’s release date and studio status by cross-referencing the album’s dedicated Wikipedia page or inline citations, treating only entries explicitly labeled *studio* and confirmed with a 2000–2009 copyright or release date as valid—just as taxonomic attribution was required for species–age linkage or societal typology demanded noun-phrase usage. If ambiguity arises (e.g., reissues or regional releases), apply structural corroboration: require consistent dating across at least two independent, authoritative sources (e.g., official discography footnotes + AllMusic/RIAA database links cited on Wikipedia) before counting.\n————End Memory————"

          "text": "[PLAN]:\n## Goal 1: Retrieve and parse Mercedes Sosa’s authoritative discography from Wikipedia’s canonical English page  \n- Path 1.1: Use `crawl_page` to fetch the “Discography” section of Mercedes Sosa’s English Wikipedia page (2022 version), targeting the stable URL `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes_Sosa#Discography`, and extract all entries under “Studio albums” using semantic section detection and HTML structure parsing.  \n  - Success: A clean list of album titles with adjacent date strings (e.g., “Cantora, vol. 1 (2009)”) extracted; non-studio entries (live, compilations, tributes) excluded by heading context and absence of “studio album” labeling.  \n- Path 1.2: If the Discography section is malformed or missing, fall back to `web_search` with query `\"Mercedes Sosa\" \"studio albums\" site:en.wikipedia.org intitle:\"Discography\"` to locate the canonical discography subpage or infobox, then apply `crawl_page` to that precise URL.  \n  - Success: Identification and successful crawling of a Wikipedia page containing a machine-extractable, labeled “Studio albums” list with release years.\n\n## Goal 2: Filter studio albums strictly within 2000–2009 using lexical and structural validation  \n- Path 2.1: Apply regex-based date extraction (`\\b200[0-9]\\b|\\b20[0-9]{2}\\b`) on text immediately surrounding each album title in the crawled list; retain only entries where the matched year falls in [2000, 2009] *and* the album is explicitly designated as a “studio album” in the same sentence or citation context.  \n  - Success: A filtered subset of albums with unambiguous, adjacent, ISO-compliant year tokens and semantic studio-label confirmation.  \n- Path 2.2: For any album with ambiguous or missing year in the primary crawl, use `crawl_page` on its individual Wikipedia album page (constructed via title + “Mercedes Sosa” + “Wikipedia”) to extract release date from infobox or “Release date” section; validate against copyright year in liner notes or label metadata cited in references.  \n  - Success: Each ambiguous album receives a verified, sourced 2000–2009 release year from its dedicated page or inline citation.\n\n## Goal 3: Cross-verify album count and studio status against at least two independent authoritative sources  \n- Path 3.1: Perform `web_search` with discriminator-stacked query `\"Mercedes Sosa\" \"studio album\" (\"2000\" OR \"2001\" OR \"2002\" OR \"2003\" OR \"2004\" OR \"2005\" OR \"2006\" OR \"2007\" OR \"2008\" OR \"2009\") site:www.discogs.com` and parse top result for Discogs’ official catalog—checking for “Type: Album”, “Format: CD/Vinyl”, and absence of “Live”, “Compilation”, or “Remastered” tags.  \n  - Success: A matching set of studio albums from Discogs, with count and titles aligned (modulo spelling variants) to Wikipedia’s filtered list.  \n- Path 3.2: Perform parallel `web_search` with query `\"Mercedes Sosa\" \"AllMusic\" \"discography\" \"2000..2009\"` and use `crawl_page` on the AllMusic artist discography URL to extract studio albums in the specified decade, filtering by “Album” category and excluding “Live”, “Box Set”, or “Compilation”.  \n  - Success: AllMusic’s count and titles corroborate the filtered Wikipedia list; discrepancies trigger reconciliation via citation tracing.\n\n## Goal 4: Resolve ambiguities (reissues, posthumous releases, regional variants) via structural corroboration  \n- Path 4.1: For any album appearing in only one source or with conflicting dates, run targeted `web_search` combining `\"Mercedes Sosa\" \"[album title]\" \"recording date\" OR \"release date\" \"2000..2009\"` and inspect top scholarly or label-press-source results (e.g., Sony Music Argentina press releases, UNESCO cultural archives) via `crawl_page`.  \n  - Success: At least two independent, high-fidelity sources (e.g., official label archive + academic biography) confirm original studio release within 2000–2009—not reissue or posthumous.  \n- Path 4.2: If ambiguity persists, use `inspect_file_as_text` on a cited PDF reference from Wikipedia’s discography footnote (e.g., a scanned book chapter or liner note scan) to extract definitive release metadata.  \n  - Success: Direct textual evidence from a primary source (e.g., “Recorded Buenos Aires, March 2005; released worldwide October 2005”) resolves status and date conclusively.\n\n## Goal 5: Aggregate and finalize count with consensus validation  \n- Path 5.1: Compile all validated studio albums across Goals 1–4 into a deduplicated, canonical list; require ≥2 of the 3 authoritative sources (Wikipedia, Discogs, AllMusic) to list *and* date each album within 2000–2009.  \n  - Success: Final list contains only albums meeting strict multi-source consensus on both studio classification and decade alignment.  \n- Path 5.2: As final validation, perform `web_search` with `\"Mercedes Sosa\" \"2000s studio albums\" count` and cross-check top-result numerical assertions against the consensus list.  \n  - Success: Search-result counts (e.g., “She released 5 studio albums between 2000 and 2009”) match the deduplicated, verified list — confirming no omission or overcount."

The first session occurred at Estudios Panda; subsequent sessions were at Estudios Ion in Buenos Aires.\n\n- **Studio album classification**: Yes — it is explicitly classified as a **studio album**, not live, compilation, or reissue. The infobox states: *“[Studio album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album \"Album\") by Mercedes Sosa”*, and the introductory paragraph calls it *“a double album by Argentine singer Mercedes Sosa, released on 2009 through Sony Music Argentina”*, noting it was *“Sosa's final album before her death”*. Its nature as a newly recorded, original studio project is further reinforced by descriptions of collaborative recording sessions with guest artists, production details, and critical reviews highlighting its acoustic arrangements and intentional sonic texture.\n\n- **Citation/reference confirming original release year**: Multiple authoritative references confirm the **2009 release year**:\n  - Infobox: “Released | March 2009 (Disc one) / June 2009 (Disc two)” — primary Wikipedia presentation.\n  - Opening paragraph: *“released on 2009 through Sony Music Argentina”* [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantora_1#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantora_1#cite_note-2).\n  - Reference #9 (cited twice): *“Los 50 mejores discos de 2009”* (“The 50 Best Albums of 2009”) by *La Nación*, December 17, 2009 — places the album in its **2009 year-end list**, confirming contemporaneous release.\n  - Category tag at page bottom: *“[Category:2009 albums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:2009_albums)”* — Wikipedia’s editorially maintained categorization.\n  - Additional contextual confirmation: The album’s Grammy nominations occurred at the *10th Annual Latin Grammy Awards* in **2009**, and it is noted as Sosa’s final album before her death on **October 4, 2009**, making a 2009 release chronologically necessary and consistent.\n\nNo ambiguity exists regarding release year, format, or originality: all evidence converges on a **2009 studio double album**, with Disc 1 issued in March and Disc 2 in June, recorded over a 13-month span ending just prior to release.\n\nResults for tool call 'crawl_page' with arguments '{'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantora_2', 'query': 'Extract the release date, recording period, and whether this is classified as a studio album (not live, compilation, or reissue).
