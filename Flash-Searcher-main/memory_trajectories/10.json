Prioritize direct citation tracing by searching the British Museum’s online collection record for object 2012,5015.17 using its exact museum number and cross-referencing linked publications—particularly the cited 2021 Science Advances article—to extract the age value from the abstract without intermediate interpretation.  \n2. Apply lexical fidelity by extracting the numeric age value only from verbatim phrases in the abstract such as “at least X thousand years old” or “≥X ka”, avoiding rounding, unit conversion, or contextual inference unless explicitly stated in the source text.  \n3. Implement discriminator stacking in search queries: combine the museum number, species name (once identified), “Science Advances 2021”, and terms like “shell bead chronology” or “oldest mollusk bead” to disambiguate from unrelated archaeological or malacological literature, then triage results by journal domain, publication date, and direct PDF access to ensure the abstract is viewed in its original layout.\n\nAGENT-KB Teacher Guidance:\nWhen tackling interdisciplinary queries involving museum collections and scientific literature, consider embedding precise identifiers—like the museum number “2012,5015.17” and journal metadata “Science Advances 2021”—directly into search strings to align with archival schema; simultaneously inspect article abstracts as textual blocks (not images) using `inspect_file_as_text`, prioritizing unambiguous lexical matches such as numeric age phrases (e.g., “≥140 ka”) that appear as noun phrases or standalone quantified claims, while cross-validating via syntactic context—like whether “thousands of years old” modifies a specific bead find—and rejecting terms lacking grammatical or structural anchoring in the abstract’s core assertions."

      "think": "I need to execute the first step of each goal in parallel as per the plan. For Goal 1 (identify mollusk species), I'll start with Path 1.1: search the British Museum's online collection using the exact museum number '2012,5015.17'. For Goal 2 (locate the 2021 Science Advances article), I'll start with Path 2.1: use a discriminator-stacked search query combining the museum number, journal name, year, and 'shell bead'. For Goal 3 (extract age value), I'll prepare to inspect the abstract once retrieved, but first need the article. For Goal 4 (cross-validate species-age linkage), I'll need both the museum record and article abstract, so those are prerequisites. For Goal 5 (resolve ambiguity), that's a fallback if needed. So the immediate parallel actions are: (1) search for BM collection record, (2) search for the Science Advances article, and (3) since the museum number format uses a comma, I should also search with the comma escaped or as '20125015.17' to handle possible formatting variations in database entries.",

The search results also consistently point to a 2021 Science Advances article about shell beads from Bizmoune Cave in Morocco, with multiple sources (PMC, Nature Asia, ResearchGate) referencing it. The abstract is likely in the PMC article (ID: PMC8457661), which is open-access and contains the full text. Since the crawl_page failed due to infrastructure issues, the next best step is to retrieve the full-text PMC article via web_search and then inspect its abstract using inspect_file_as_text. Additionally, we need to confirm the age value — the Nature Asia and PMC articles both reference 'oldest-known shell beads', and the context strongly suggests an age >100 ka; however, per lexical fidelity guidance, we must extract the exact phrase from the original abstract.

      "think": "We have successfully identified the mollusk species as 'Nassa gibbosula' (also known as Nassarius gibbosulus) from the British Museum's collection record for object 2012,5015.17. The web search results strongly point to the 2021 Science Advances article 'Early Middle Stone Age personal ornaments from Bizmoune Cave, Essaouira, Morocco' (DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.abi8620), which reports on shell beads from this species. The PMC page (PMC8457661) is the open-access version of that article. Since the `inspect_file_as_text` tool failed on the URL due to a 403 error, we must retrieve the abstract directly via a reliable source. The PubMed entry (pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34550742/) provides the official citation and likely links to the full text or abstract. We will use `web_search` to locate the official Science Advances journal page for DOI 10.1126/sciadv.abi8620 and then use `crawl_page` to extract the abstract — the most authoritative and layout-accurate source per Teacher Guidance. Simultaneously, we’ll search for the exact age phrase using high-fidelity lexical terms like '≥140 ka' or 'at least 140 thousand years old' in conjunction with the species and article title to confirm the number without relying on potentially paraphrased secondary sources.",
