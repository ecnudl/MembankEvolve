Explicitly model the false positive rate using the alpha level and statistical power assumptions—rather than assuming all p = 0.04 findings are equally credible, anchor the calculation in a realistic prior probability (e.g., 10–30% true effect prevalence) and estimated average power (~20–40% for typical underpowered studies), as validated in meta-research on reproducibility crises.  \n2. Decompose the estimation into two parallel validation paths: one applying the standard Type I error framework (p < 0.05 → 5% false positives *if null is always true*), and another using Bayes’ theorem with empirically grounded priors (e.g., Ioannidis-style modeling), then reconcile discrepancies by identifying which assumption—uniform null prevalence or uniform power—is most inconsistent with Nature’s 2020 publication profile.  \n3. Cross-validate the final count against known benchmarks—such as the 2018 *Nature Human Behaviour* reproducibility survey reporting ~36% of high-impact psychology papers failed replication, or the 2020 *PNAS* meta-analysis estimating 14–25% false discovery rates in top-tier journals—using these as sanity-check bounds rather than theoretical extremes.\n\nAGENT-KB Teacher Guidance:\nTo estimate the number of incorrect claims of statistical significance, treat the p-value threshold (0.05) and observed average (0.04) as probabilistic anchors—just as axis labels or ZIP codes require syntactic precision—so compute the expected false positive rate using the uniform null distribution assumption (i.e., under H₀, p-values are uniformly distributed, so the proportion ≤ 0.04 is 0.04, not 0.05). Then multiply that rate by the total count of Nature 2020 research articles (a verified, discrete corpus size—not estimated from proxies), and round up using ceiling logic, mirroring how ZIP validation preserved leading zeros or how age values were extracted without unit reinterpretation. Crucially, avoid conflating methodological assumptions (e.g., “all papers relied on p < 0.05”) with empirical reality (e.g., actual Type I error control); instead, anchor the calculation in verifiable metadata—like arXiv submission dates or USGS specimen records—by sourcing Nature’s official 2020 article count from its annual publishing statistics or PubMed/MEDLINE-indexed totals, cross-validated across at least two authoritative bibliographic sources."
