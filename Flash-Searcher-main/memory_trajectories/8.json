Prioritize GitHub API-based issue retrieval over web scraping to ensure temporal precision—use `search_issues` with `label:Regression`, `state:closed`, and `sort:created-asc` to directly fetch the oldest closed issue matching criteria, avoiding unreliable snippet timestamps or pagination inconsistencies.  \n2. Enforce strict label-and-state validation by cross-referencing the returned issue’s `labels` array for exact `'Regression'` string match and confirming `state == 'closed'` in the raw response—preventing misattribution from label aliases (e.g., ‘regression’, ‘bug’) or prematurely closed issues.  \n3. Extract the creation date from the issue’s `created_at` field (ISO 8601) and convert it to MM/DD/YY format using deterministic parsing—never inferring date from PRs, comments, or commit history—to anchor the answer solely to the issue’s canonical GitHub metadata.\n\nAGENT-KB Teacher Guidance:\nTo locate the date when the Regression label was added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue on GitHub, begin by using precise structural and temporal constraints in your search—such as `repo:numpy/numpy label:Regression is:issue is:closed \"numpy.polynomial\"`—and sort results by created date (not updated or closed date) to identify the oldest. Since GitHub does not expose label-addition timestamps directly in issue listings, you’ll need to retrieve the full issue timeline via the GitHub API or inspect raw event data (e.g., using `curl -H \"Accept: application/vnd.github+json\"` with pagination), then parse label-related events (e.g., `labeled` events) to extract the exact timestamp—taking care to cast and normalize dates to MM/DD/YY format without truncation or locale assumptions. As demonstrated across domains, always anchor validation in syntactic evidence (e.g., matching `\"Regression\"` as a literal label name in event payloads, not inferred from titles or comments) and cross-verify against authoritative source structures (e.g., GitHub’s official event types and issue state transitions) rather than relying on third-party summaries or UI-rendered approximations."
