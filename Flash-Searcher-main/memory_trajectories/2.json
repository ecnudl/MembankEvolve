      "value": "## Goal 1: Confirm the correct scientific name of the *Finding Nemo* clownfish  \n- Path 1.1: Perform a precise web search using authoritative biological and cinematic sources to verify whether the movie’s main character is *Amphiprion ocellaris* (commonly called the false or common clownfish) or *Amphiprion percula* (the true percula clownfish), with emphasis on taxonomic consensus in ichthyology databases (e.g., FishBase, WoRMS, IUCN) and production notes from Pixar/Disney.  \n  - Success: Return unambiguous, peer-recognized species identification supported by at least two independent authoritative sources (e.g., FishBase + WoRMS), explicitly resolving any ambiguity between *A. ocellaris* and *A. percula*.  \n- Path 1.2: Crawl official educational or outreach pages from USGS NAS or NOAA Fisheries that discuss *Finding Nemo*–associated species introductions, extracting stated scientific names and contextual usage (e.g., “often misidentified as…”).  \n  - Success: Retrieve direct quotation or metadata from a USGS or NOAA page naming the species linked to *Finding Nemo*, with timestamped publication date prior to 2023.  \n\n## Goal 2: Locate the official USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) Database entry for the confirmed species  \n- Path 2.1: Execute a targeted `web_search` querying `\"USGS NAS\" \"[Confirmed_Species_Name]\" site:nas.er.usgs.gov`, where `[Confirmed_Species_Name]` is the exact binomial (e.g., `\"Amphiprion percula\"` or `\"Amphiprion ocellaris\"`), to retrieve the canonical species report page URL.  \n  - Success: Obtain a valid, live USGS NAS species profile URL (e.g., `https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/FactSheet.aspx?SpeciesID=XXX`) containing occurrence data.  \n- Path 2.2: If Path 2.1 yields no direct hit, use `web_search` with `\"USGS NAS\" \"[Confirmed_Species_Name]\" \"map viewer\" OR \"download data\"` to locate either the interactive Map Viewer interface or a bulk-data download link (e.g., CSV/JSON export endpoint) for nonnative records.  \n  - Success: Retrieve a functional URL enabling access to geolocated, pre-2020 occurrence records—either via HTML table, map-layer metadata, or structured data file.  \n\n## Goal 3: Extract pre-2020 nonnative USGS occurrences with zip-code–level precision  \n- Path 3.1: Use `crawl_page` on the confirmed NAS species report or Map Viewer page to extract all listed localities; apply regex pattern `\\b\\d{5}\\b` to identify five-digit ZIP codes, then filter results retaining only those associated with collection/detection dates before 2020 (explicitly stated in text or table cells adjacent to ZIP).  \n  - Success: Return a non-empty list of ZIP codes, each verifiably tied to a documented, pre-2020 USGS-recorded detection event and formatted as exactly five ASCII digits.  \n- Path 3.2: If ZIPs are absent from the primary page, use `crawl_page` on any linked “Detailed Records”, “Specimen Data”, or “Download CSV” URL to parse tabular or JSON-formatted occurrence data; filter rows where `year < 2020` and `locality_type == \"ZIP Code\"` or equivalent field, then extract `zip_code` values.  \n  - Success: Parse structured data to yield ≥1 ZIP code satisfying temporal and geographic precision constraints, with provenance traceable to USGS NAS schema fields.  \n\n## Goal 4: Validate ZIP code authenticity against USGS source authority and formatting  \n- Path 4.1: For each candidate ZIP from Goal 3, perform a secondary `web_search` using `\"USGS NAS\" \"[ZIP]\" \"[Confirmed_Species_Name]\" \"2019\"` (or other pre-2020 year) to locate original reporting documents or news releases corroborating that specific ZIP’s inclusion.  \n  - Success: At least one search returns a USGS-hosted page (e.g., NAS Alert, Field Report, or Archive PDF) explicitly listing the ZIP and species with pre-2020 date.  \n- Path 4.2: Cross-check each ZIP against the USPS ZIP Code Lookup tool (via `crawl_page` on `https://tools.usps.com/zip-code-lookup.htm?citybyzipcode` is *not* feasible — instead, validate format and plausibility using known US ZIP ranges and eliminate invalid patterns (e.g., `00000`, `99999`, leading zeros not in 5-digit string) via internal logic after extraction.  \n  - Success: All ZIPs pass syntactic validation (exactly five digits, numeric-only, within 00501–99950 range) and are not flagged as exclusively PO-box or deprecated codes per public USPS documentation summaries.  \n\n## Goal 5: Compile and deduplicate final ZIP code list in required format  \n- Path 5.1: Aggregate all ZIPs validated across Goals 3 and 4, remove duplicates, sort numerically, and join with commas. Confirm output matches regex `^\\d{5}(,\\d{5})*$`.  \n  - Success: A single string of comma-separated, sorted, unique five-digit ZIP codes (e.g., `\"33139,33189\"`), containing ≥1 ZIP and no extraneous characters or whitespace.  \n- Path 5.2: If zero ZIPs survive validation, execute fallback `web_search` with `\"Finding Nemo\" clownfish invasive USGS zip code before 2020` + `site:.gov`, then manually inspect top three `.gov` results (using `crawl_page`) for any mention of ZIP-level nonnative detections — extract and validate any found.  \n  - Success: Either produces ≥1 additional validated ZIP, or conclusively confirms “no pre-2020 USGS-reported nonnative occurrences at ZIP-code level exist” — which would trigger `final_answer` with empty string or explicit null statement per task requirements.",

Decompose the task into sequential verification steps: first confirm the fish species identity (Amphiprion ocellaris) using authoritative pet-trade and invasive-species databases (e.g., USGS NAS, NAS Database API), then restrict USGS nonnative occurrence queries to pre-2020 records with explicit zip-code-level geolocation—avoiding county- or state-level aggregations that lack required granularity.  \n2. Apply discriminator stacking in searches by combining four precise filters: species scientific name (“Amphiprion ocellaris”), temporal bound (“before 2020”), geographic precision (“zip code”, “5-digit postal code”), and source authority (“USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species database”)—iteratively refining queries to exclude ambiguous terms like “clownfish” or “Nemo” that introduce noise.  \n3. Prioritize direct data retrieval from the USGS NAS Map Viewer or its underlying CSV/JSON export (if accessible via `crawl_page` with URL pattern matching) over HTML scraping, and validate each returned zip code against USGS’s official occurrence reports by cross-referencing specimen collection dates and georeferenced point records—rejecting any result lacking verifiable, pre-2020 provenance and five-digit postal formatting.\n\nAGENT-KB Teacher Guidance:\nWhen searching for USGS-reported nonnative occurrences of the *Amphiprion percula* (the clownfish from *Finding Nemo*), embed the exact species name and temporal constraint (“before 2020”) as verbatim lexical anchors in quotes—e.g., `\"Amphiprion percula\" \"nonnative\" \"USGS\" \"before 2020\"`—to align with authoritative database metadata schemas and avoid false positives from colloquial or misspelled references; prioritize official USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) Database outputs, and when zip code–level locality data is not directly listed, use `web_search` with targeted queries like `\"USGS NAS\" \"Amphiprion percula\" site:\"nas.er.usgs.gov\"` to retrieve occurrence reports containing geocoded addresses, then extract five-digit zip codes via precise pattern matching (e.g., `\\b\\d{5}\\b`) only where explicitly tied to verified, pre-2020 detection events."

For Goal 2 (USGS NAS entry location), I'll start with Path 2.1: a targeted search for the USGS NAS page using the most likely species name — but since the species is ambiguous, I'll search for both binomials separately to cover possibilities. For Goal 3 (ZIP extraction), I can't proceed until species is confirmed, so I'll defer crawling for now.

Simultaneously, to verify NAS database structure and locate actual occurrence data, we search for the USGS NAS Map Viewer homepage and official documentation on how to interpret locality fields — since ZIP-level data may be embedded in downloadable datasets or map-layer metadata rather than HTML species pages.

Concurrently, to resolve the taxonomic ambiguity definitively and locate official USGS documentation, we’ll perform a broader `web_search` for `'USGS NAS' 'clownfish' 'Amphiprion' 'nonindigenous' site:nas.er.usgs.gov` — this avoids over-constraining with 'ocellaris' or 'percula' and lets USGS’s own metadata schema surface the correct entry. Finally, since prior searches for ZIP codes failed, we’ll execute a targeted `web_search` for documented invasive clownfish releases in U.S. coastal areas (e.g., Florida, Hawaii, California), filtering for pre-2020 news reports or agency alerts mentioning specific cities or postal codes — these may cite USGS data indirectly and provide ZIPs we can then validate.",

The NAS Map Viewer page did not contain ZIP codes, but the FactSheet and Collections pages are likely to contain occurrence locality details — especially since the 'Collections' page explicitly mentions 'Point Map' and '1 result', suggesting georeferenced records. Also, the 'FactSheet.aspx?speciesID=3243' URL from the search results is the canonical authoritative source for nonindigenous occurrences and is dynamically updated from the database — this is Goal 2’s Path 2.1 success. For Goal 3, we must now crawl that FactSheet to extract pre-2020 nonnative localities; however, ZIP codes may not be directly listed, so we’ll query for 'county', 'state', 'location', 'record', 'date', '2019', '2018', etc., and look for any numeric 5-digit patterns adjacent to location descriptors. Separately, the 'Collections' page (collectioninfo.aspx?SpeciesID=3243) may list specimen collection points with finer granularity — it's worth crawling both in parallel. Finally, since no ZIPs appeared in earlier searches or crawls, we must also execute a fallback targeted search for documented invasive clownfish detections in US coastal states (FL, HI, CA) with emphasis on municipal-level reporting — even if not ZIP-coded, news or agency reports sometimes include ZIPs in incident descriptions.",

Confirm output matches regex `^\\d{5}(,\\d{5})*$`.  \n  - Success: A single string of comma-separated, sorted, unique five-digit ZIP codes (e.g., `\"33139,33189\"`), containing ≥1 ZIP and no extraneous characters or whitespace.  \n- Path 5.2: If zero ZIPs survive validation, execute fallback `web_search` with `\"Finding Nemo\" clownfish invasive USGS zip code before 2020` + `site:.gov`, then manually inspect top three `.gov` results (using `crawl_page`) for any mention of ZIP-level nonnative detections — extract and validate any found.  \n  - Success: Either produces ≥1 additional validated ZIP, or conclusively confirms “no pre-2020 USGS-reported nonnative occurrences at ZIP-code level exist” — which would trigger `final_answer` with empty string or explicit null statement per task requirements."

Relevant content matching the search query includes:\n\n- **Specimen Records**: Explicitly referenced in the tab navigation (“[Specimen Records](https://nas.er.usgs.gov/viewer/omap.aspx?id=1123cf6e-a934-426f-b448-d427d4bd352a#recordsTab)”) and described under “Species Observations” as “Clustered Specimen Records” and “Individual Specimens”. The term *specimen* is central to the data model.\n\n- **Locality**: Implied through spatial tools — “Search by Area”, “Draw Polygon”, “Draw Circle”, “Polygon from WKT”, and administrative/hydrologic layers (e.g., “Administrative Boundaries”, “County”, “HUC” codes). While the word *locality* does not appear verbatim, geographic context (e.g., county, HUC, draw tools) serves the same functional purpose.\n\n- **Zip code / Postal code**: Not mentioned anywhere on the page.\n\n- **Record**: Used repeatedly — “Specimen Records”, “eDNA Records”, “record” appears in “Specimen Records” tab label and “Clustered Specimen Records”. Also implied in “Database & Queries” section and metadata references.\n\n- **Date / Year / 2019, 2018, 2017**: No specific years or date fields are visible on this page. The citation shows “Accessed [2/23/2026]” (placeholder), and metadata link points to “2016-10-24_NAS_Metadata.pdf”, but no 2017/2018/2019 dates appear in the displayed content.\n\n- **Detection**: Explicitly used in “eDNA Records” and “eDNA Data Notice”, which states: “Environmental DNA detection data does not indicate the organism is present, only its genetic material…”. So *detection* is directly tied to eDNA methodology.\n\n- **Download**: A download icon (![Download data](https://nas.er.usgs.gov/viewer/newmap/images/icons/download.png)) is present with tooltip “Download data”, indicating capability to export results — consistent with request for CSV/JSON/table formats. However, no explicit mention of *CSV*, *JSON*, or *table* occurs on this page.\n\n- **Table**: Not mentioned.\n\n- **Metadata**: Linked as “[Metadata](https://nas.er.usgs.gov/about/Metadata.aspx)” and referenced in the disclaimer (“reviewing [metadata](https://nas.er.usgs.gov/about/2016-10-24_NAS_Metadata.pdf) files”), suggesting structured data documentation — potentially including locality, date, and record fields — but the metadata itself is not shown here.\n\n- **Other**: “Query”, “Spatial Query”, “Database Info”, and “API Documentation” suggest underlying structured data, but no field-level schema (e.g., columns like zip code or postal code) is exposed on this map viewer page.\n\nIn summary, the page explicitly supports:  \n✓ Specimen records  \n✓ Detection (via eDNA)  \n✓ Record-based spatial queries  \n✓ Download functionality (icon present)  \n✓ Locality inference via mapping tools (county, HUC, polygon drawing)  \n✗ No mention of zip code, postal code, CSV, JSON, table, or years 2017–2019  \n✗ Date field is not visible; year references are limited to metadata filename (2016) and placeholder access date  \n\nNo relevant information for zip code, postal code, CSV, JSON, table, or the specific years 2017/2018/2019.\n\nResults for tool call 'web_search' with arguments '{'query': \"'USGS NAS' 'clownfish' 'Amphiprion' 'nonindigenous' site:nas.er.usgs.gov\"}':\n1.

However, **2019** appears in “**Revision Date: 5/24/2019**” and “Peer Review Date: 5/24/2019”, indicating document update—not an occurrence year. No occurrences reported for 2016, 2017, or 2019.\n\n- **Florida, Hawaii, California**: Only **Florida** is listed in Table 1 under “States with nonindigenous occurrences”. **Hawaii** and **California** are *not mentioned* as occurrence states. Hawaii appears only in a reference (Randall 2005: *Reef and Shore Fishes of the South Pacific: New Caledonia to Tahiti and the Pitcairn Islands. University of Hawai’i Press, Honolulu.*) — citing a publication source, not a U.S. occurrence. **California** and cities **Miami**, **Honolulu**, **San Diego** are *absent* from all occurrence text and tables.\n\n- **Detection & Release**: “**Means of Introduction: Probable aquarium release**” — directly matches “release” and “aquarium” from the query. “Detection” is implied by “collected” and “observed”, though the term “detection” itself does not appear.\n\n- **Pet & Aquarium**: Explicitly stated: “Clown anemone fish are popular in the **aquarium trade**” and “among the top **aquarium fish** imported…”, and “one of the most commonly-cultured marine species”. Also ties introduction to “**Probable aquarium release**”.\n\n- **Other terms**: “Record” is reflected in hyperlinked specimen records (e.g., “Names and dates are hyperlinked to their relevant specimen records”). “County” and “state” are used structurally (e.g., “Pinellas Co., Florida”; Table 1 column headers). “Location” is satisfied by “Fred Howard Park”.\n\n- **No mentions** of: Miami, Honolulu, San Diego, Hawaii (as occurrence site), California (as occurrence state), 2016, 2017, or 2019 (as occurrence years).\n\nSummary table (Table 1) confirms:\n- State: **FL**  \n- First Observed: **2018**  \n- Last Observed: **2018**  \n- Total HUCs: 1 → **Crystal-Pithlachascotee** (HUC 03100207)  \n- Status: “Eradicated. Specimen was removed alive and transferred to the Clearwater Marine Aquarium.”\n\nAll other queried geographic terms (Hawaii, California, Miami, Honolulu, San Diego) and years (2016, 2017, 2019) appear only incidentally (e.g., publisher location “Honolulu”, revision date “2019”) — *not* as occurrence data.\n\nThus, only **one verified nonindigenous occurrence** matches the query:  \n→ *Amphiprion ocellaris*, detected via collection, likely released from an aquarium, in **Fred Howard Park, Pinellas County, Florida**, in **July 2018**.\n\nResults for tool call 'crawl_page' with arguments '{'url': 'https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/collectioninfo.aspx?SpeciesID=3243', 'query': 'Collection Info, Point Map, location, latitude, longitude, county, state, date, year, 2019, 2018, 2017, specimen, record, Miami, Honolulu, San Diego, Florida, Hawaii, California'}':\nRelevant content matching the search query from the web page includes:\n\n- **Collection Info**: Explicitly linked as “[Collection Info](https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/collectioninfo.aspx?SpeciesID=3243)” — the current page itself is the Collection Info page for *Amphiprion ocellaris* (Species ID 3243).\n\n- **Point Map**: Direct link provided: “[Point Map](https://nas.er.usgs.gov/viewer/omap.aspx?SpeciesID=3243)”.\n\n- **Location, County, State**: One specimen record is listed:\n  - **State**: FL (Florida)  \n  - **County**: Pinellas  \n  - **Locality**: “Gulf of America, Florida, Fred Howard Park” — note: “Gulf of America” appears to be an error (likely intended as *Gulf of Mexico*); location is in Florida, not Miami, Honolulu, or San Diego.\n\n- **Latitude/Longitude**: Not explicitly stated anywhere on the page. No coordinate values (e.g., decimal degrees) appear in the visible content.\n\n- **Date/Year**: The sole record shows **Year = 2018**. No full date (e.g., month/day) or other years (2019, 2017) are present.\n\n- **Specimen & Record**: A single specimen record is shown:\n  - **Specimen ID**: [1468741](https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/SpecimenViewer.aspx?SpecimenID=1468741)  \n  - **Status**: eradicated  \n  - **HUC Number**: 03100207  \n  - **Drainage name**: Crystal-Pithlachascotee  \n\n- **Geographic Names Matching Query**:  \n  - ✅ Florida (abbreviated as “FL”) — matches “Florida” and “state”.  \n  - ❌ Miami, Honolulu, San Diego — none appear in the content.  \n  - ❌ Hawaii and California — not mentioned; no “HI” or “CA” state entries.  \n\n- **Other Query Terms**:  \n  - “2019”, “2017”: Not present. Only **2018** appears.  \n  - “record”, “specimen”: Used contextually (e.g., “1 result”, “Specimen ID”, “collection records”).  \n  - “Data Disclaimer” section references “collection records”, “preliminary or provisional” data, and cautions about distribution interpretation — relevant to “record” and data reliability.\n\n- **Metadata & Contextual Info**:  \n  - Page cites metadata ([link](https://nas.er.usgs.gov/about/2016-10-24_NAS_Metadata.pdf)) and notes data limitations — supports understanding of “Collection Info” rigor.  \n  - Citation line states database is hosted in “Gainesville, Florida”, but this is administrative, not a collection location.\n\n- **No mention of**: latitude, longitude, county beyond “Pinellas”, or any other counties/states from the query list (e.g., no Honolulu → Hawaii, no San Diego → California).\n\nSummary: The page provides one verified nonindigenous specimen record for *Amphiprion ocellaris*, collected in **2018**, in **Pinellas County, Florida**, with locality details and links to Collection Info and Point Map. No coordinates, no other years (2017/2019), and none of the queried cities (Miami, Honolulu, San Diego) or additional states (Hawaii, California) appear.\n\nResults for tool call 'web_search' with arguments '{'query': '\"Amphiprion ocellaris\" \"nonnative\" OR \"invasive\" \"Florida\" OR \"Hawaii\" OR \"California\" \"2019\" OR \"2018\" OR \"2017\" \"zip code\" OR \"postal code\" site:.gov'}':\n1.
