      "value": "## Goal 1: Identify the June 2022 AI regulation paper on arXiv.org containing a three-axis figure with labeled ends  \n- Path 1.1: Perform a web search for arXiv papers from June 2022 about AI regulation featuring multi-axis figures (e.g., “AI regulation” AND (“three-axis” OR “triangular” OR “3D axis”) AND arXiv AND 2022-06)  \n - Success: Retrieve at least one candidate arXiv paper ID (e.g., arXiv:2206.xxxxx) and its title; verify it was submitted in June 2022 via metadata  \n- Path 1.2: Search arXiv’s official API or metadata archive (via web search) for papers in cs.AI or cs.CY categories submitted between 2022-06-01 and 2022-06-30 with keywords “governance”, “regulation”, “framework”, and filter for those mentioning “figure”, “axis”, or “dimensional model” in abstract  \n  - Success: Obtain a shortlist of ≤3 candidate papers with submission dates and abstracts confirming presence of a multi-axis visual  \n\n## Goal 2: Extract the six endpoint labels from the three-axis figure in the identified paper  \n- Path 2.1: Use `crawl_page` to fetch the PDF URL of the June 2022 paper (e.g., https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.xxxxx.pdf), then use `inspect_file_as_text` to extract text and search for figure captions or section describing the three-axis diagram; locate axis label terms  \n - Success: Identify all six distinct words (two per axis, e.g., “Centralized”–“Decentralized”, “Static”–“Adaptive”, etc.) explicitly stated as axis endpoints  \n- Path 2.2: If text extraction fails to resolve labels unambiguously, use `inspect_file_as_image` on the first few pages of the PDF to locate and interpret the figure visually — query for “three-axis diagram” and “labels at both ends of each axis”  \n  - Success: Return six clear, legible words corresponding to the termini of the three axes  \n\n## Goal 3: Identify the Physics and Society article submitted to arXiv.org on August 11, 2016  \n- Path 3.1: Perform targeted web search: “arXiv Physics and Society 2016-08-11” + (“society” OR “social system” OR “type of society”) to locate the exact paper (e.g., arXiv:1608.xxxxx)  \n - Success: Retrieve precise arXiv ID and title of the August 11, 2016 Physics and Society paper  \n- Path 3.2: Search arXiv’s daily listing archive (e.g., via “arXiv:1608.00000 [physics.soc-ph]” pattern + date filters) using web search; cross-check submission timestamp metadata  \n  - Success: Confirm submission date is exactly 2016-08-11 and category is physics.soc-ph (Physics and Society)  \n\n## Goal 4: Determine which of the six axis-end words appears in the title or abstract of the August 2016 Physics and Society paper  \n- Path 4.1: Fetch the August 2016 paper’s PDF via `crawl_page`, then use `inspect_file_as_text` to extract title, abstract, and introduction; search for exact matches of each of the six words  \n - Success: Identify ≥1 word from Goal 2’s list that appears verbatim in the 2016 paper’s title or abstract  \n- Path 4.2: If PDF text is poorly extracted, fetch the arXiv HTML abstract page and use `crawl_page` with query “title and abstract text”, then perform keyword matching  \n  - Success: Same as Path 4.1 — unambiguous lexical match confirmed in authoritative abstract/title source  \n\n## Goal 5: Validate that the matched word is used to describe *a type of society* in the 2016 article  \n- Path 5.1: Use `inspect_file_as_text` on the full 2016 paper (or its HTML abstract) with focused question: “In what context is [matched_word] used? Does it describe a societal structure, model, or classification of society?”  \n - Success: Extract a sentence or phrase from the paper explicitly using the word as a noun modifier for “society” (e.g., “decentralized society”, “adaptive society”, “post-industrial society”) or as a standalone societal typology term  \n- Path 5.2: If ambiguity remains, crawl supplementary materials or cited references in the 2016 paper to confirm disciplinary usage of the term in social physics contexts  \n  - Success: Corroborating evidence (e.g., definition in text or citation to sociology/physics-society literature) confirming the word denotes a recognized *type of society*",

      "think": "I need to execute the plan in parallel across all five goals. For Goal 1 (identify June 2022 AI regulation paper with three-axis figure), I'll start with Path 1.1: a precise web search for arXiv papers from June 2022 on AI regulation mentioning 'three-axis' or similar terms. For Goal 2 (extract axis labels), I cannot proceed yet without the paper ID, so it will wait for Goal 1's output. For Goal 3 (find Aug 11, 2016 Physics and Society article), I'll run Path 3.1: a targeted web search for arXiv papers in physics.soc-ph category submitted exactly on 2016-08-11. For Goal 4 and 5 (match and validate word usage), those depend on outputs from Goals 1 and 3, so they’ll follow later.

Extract the exact terms used.'}':\n1. Short answer  \nThe label words at both ends of each of the three axes in Figure 1 are:  \n- Axis 1 (Standardization vs. Localization): **Standardized** and **Localized**  \n- Axis 2 (Utilitarian vs. Egalitarian): **Utilitarian** and **Egalitarian**  \n- Axis 3 (Consequential vs. Deontological): **Consequential** and **Deontological**  \n\nThese exact terms appear in the caption and labels of Figure 1 (described in Section 7 and visually summarized in the figure’s schematic, explicitly named in the text on p. 12–14 and in the summary on p. 14: “LED end” = Localized, Egalitarian, Deontological; “SUC end” = Standardized, Utilitarian, Consequential).\n\n2. Extremely detailed answer  \nThe question asks for the *exact label words* appearing *at both ends* of *each of the three axes* in **Figure 1**, as presented in the provided document.\n\nWe locate Figure 1 in Section 7 (“Mapping Perspectives”), specifically referenced in subsection 7.3.2 and described in the caption on page 12 (just before the figure) and again in the summary paragraph on page 14:\n\n> “Summary: Based on the pattern of high-level characterizations and common arguments made for, and against, each end of the identiﬁed axes, we place them along a single axis, with one end containing **localized, deontological, egalitarian** approaches (LED) and the other end containing **standardized, utilitarian, consequential** approaches (SUC); we illustrate this mapping in **Figure 1**.” (p. 14)\n\nCrucially, the figure itself is not embedded as an image in the text—but its *labels are fully specified in the surrounding textual description*, and — most definitively — in the **figure caption** printed *immediately above* the figure on page 12:\n\n> **Figure 1**: Three identiﬁed axes along which the debate about regulation of fairness in AI falls; Here they are aligned along **high-level characterizations** and **common arguments made for, and against, each of the ends of the identiﬁed axes**.\n\nThen, on the same page (p. 12), the figure is *visually represented in ASCII-style schematic form* (as is common in plain-text PDFs or arXiv preprints), reproduced here from the document:\n\n```\nStandardized    Localized\nEgalitarian     Utilitarian\nConsequential   Deontological\nSubjective      Hard to deploy\nInclusive       Objective\nEasy to deploy  Majoritarian\n```\n\nHowever — this block is *not* the figure itself, but rather a *textual rendering* of the figure’s layout used for accessibility/printing. The key is that the *first row* corresponds to Axis 1, the *second row* to Axis 2, and the *third row* to Axis 3 — as confirmed by the section structure (7.1, 7.2, 7.3) and the explicit naming in the summary.\n\nLet’s verify each axis using *both structural context and direct textual labeling*:\n\n- **Axis 1: Standardization vs. Localization**  \n  Section 7.1 is titled “Axis-1: Standardization vs. Localization”. Its subsection 7.1.1 defines the axis and states:  \n  > “Standardization entails the process of making things of the same type all have the same basic features… By contrast, localization describes the process of making a product or a service more suitable for a particular country, area, etc.”  \n  In the schematic block, the first line reads:  \n  `Standardized    Localized`  \n  ✅ Exact match — these are the two end-labels.\n\n- **Axis 2: Utilitarian vs. Egalitarian**  \n  Section 7.2 is titled “Axis-2: Utilitarian vs. Egalitarian”. Subsection 7.2.1 states:  \n  > “The second axis of interest addresses diﬀerences between **utilitarian** and **egalitarian** views.”  \n  In the schematic block, the second line reads:  \n  `Egalitarian     Utilitarian`  \n  Note the order is reversed (Egalitarian first, then Utilitarian), but the *terms themselves* are identical and unambiguous. The paper consistently treats them as binary opposites (e.g., “Utilitarianism vs. Egalitarianism” in the Abstract and Section 7 intro). The figure places them at opposite ends — order does not affect label identity.  \n  ✅ Exact terms: **Egalitarian**, **Utilitarian**\n\n- **Axis 3: Consequential vs. Deontological**  \n  Section 7.3 is titled “Axis-3: Consequential vs. Deontological”. Subsection 7.3.1 states:  \n  > “This third axis of interest [...] represents the diﬀerences between **consequential** and **deontological** ethics.”  \n  In the schematic block, the third line reads:  \n  `Consequential   Deontological`  \n  ✅ Exact match — and note the precise orthography: “Consequential” (not “Consequentialist”) and “Deontological” (not “Deontic” or “Duty-based”). These are the exact adjectival forms used throughout the paper (e.g., Abstract: “Consequential vs. Deontological ethics”; Section 6: “consequential and deontological ethics”; Section 7.3.1: “consequential and deontological ethics”).\n\nImportantly, the paper *never uses synonyms or variants* for these labels in describing the axes. All cross-references (Abstract, Introduction, Section 7 summary, figure caption, and schematic) use only these six exact lexical items — capitalized as proper axis descriptors in the schematic, and lowercase when used descriptively in running text (but always the same root words).\n\nThus, the label words at the ends are:\n- Axis 1: **Standardized**, **Localized**  \n- Axis 2: **Utilitarian**, **Egalitarian**  \n- Axis 3: **Consequential**, **Deontological**  \n\n(All extracted verbatim, case-matched to their appearance in the schematic block and section headings.)\n\n3. Additional Context on the document and question asked  \nThis document is an interdisciplinary academic position paper — “Fairness in Agreement With European Values: An Interdisciplinary Perspective on AI Regulation” — authored by 8 scholars across law, computer science, philosophy, and social sciences. It was submitted in July 2022 and engages critically with the European Commission’s 2021 Proposal for an Artificial Intelligence Act.\n\nFigure 1 is a conceptual framework introduced in Section 7 to synthesize divergent disciplinary viewpoints into three fundamental normative tensions. It is *not* an empirical plot or data visualization, but a *heuristic mapping device*: a triaxial schema organizing arguments *for* and *against* positions along philosophical, legal, and practical dimensions.\n\nThe question asks for “label words at both ends of each of the three axes in Figure 1”, and crucially instructs to “extract the exact terms used”. This implies strict fidelity to the text — no paraphrasing, no inferring synonyms (e.g., “standardisation” UK spelling is not used; “deontic” does not appear; “outcome-based” is discussed but never labels the axis). The document deliberately chooses concise, parallel, adjectival English terms — all ending in “-ized”, “-itarian”, “-itarian”, “-al”, “-al”, “-al” — to enable the LED/SUC acronym mnemonic (p. 14), reinforcing that these six words are the canonical, author-intended labels.\n\nThe presence of the schematic block (`Standardized Localized`, etc.) — though typographically rudimentary — functions *as the figure* in this plain-text version. Its inclusion immediately after the figure caption and before the prose discussion confirms it is the authoritative representation of Figure 1’s labeling. No ambiguity arises from missing graphics: the labels are fully specified in-text and unambiguously assigned to axes via section numbering and definitional passages.\n\nHence, the answer is grounded entirely in the document’s own self-referential, internally consistent terminology — making extraction unambiguous and objective.\n\nResults for tool call 'inspect_file_as_text' with arguments '{'file_path': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.03637.pdf', 'question': \"What words in this paper describe types of society? Specifically, does it use any of the following as societal descriptors: 'egalitarian', 'hierarchical', 'centralized', 'decentralized', 'static', 'adaptive', 'top-down', 'bottom-up', 'cooperative', 'competitive'? And in what context — e.g., 'egalitarian society' or 'hierarchical society'?\"}':\n**1. Short answer**  \nYes — the paper explicitly and repeatedly uses **‘egalitarian’** and **‘hierarchical’** as core societal descriptors, always in the context of *types of society*: e.g., *“egalitarian society”*, *“hierarchical society”*, *“transition from egalitarian to hierarchical societies”*. It also uses **‘cooperative’** (e.g., *“capacity to cooperate”*, *“cooperative behavior”*) and **‘competitive’** (e.g., *“competition between cognitive and social constraints”*, *“competition between cognitive constraints and social navigation needs”*) — but **not** as direct *societal type labels* (i.e., not “competitive society” or “cooperative society”). The remaining terms — *centralized, decentralized, static, adaptive, top-down, bottom-up* — **do not appear at all** in the text.\n\n---\n\n**2. Extremely detailed answer**  \n\nThe paper systematically employs sociological terminology to characterize macro-level social organization, with precise, theory-anchored usage:\n\n✅ **‘Egalitarian’**:  \n- Appears **34 times**, almost exclusively modifying *society*, *structure*, *organization*, or *phase*.  \n- Key phrases:  \n  - *“egalitarian society”* (e.g., Abstract: *“Phase transition from egalitarian to hierarchical societies”*; Sec. I: *“Paleolithic humans… most likely had a largely egalitarian society”*)  \n  - *“egalitarian structures”*, *“egalitarian-symmetric state”*, *“egalitarian phase”*, *“egalitarian organization”*, *“egalitarian perception”*, *“egalitarian-hierarchical spectrum”*  \n- Used both descriptively (*“modern hunter-gatherers in mild climates a trend towards an intermediate hierarchy degree”*) and theoretically (*“symmetric phase”*, *“unbroken symmetry phase”* — Fig. 3 caption).  \n- Strongly tied to cognitive capacity (encephalization) and small group size.\n\n✅ **‘Hierarchical’**:  \n- Appears **47 times**, equally central and consistently paired with *society*, *structure*, *order*, *phase*, or *organization*.  \n- Key phrases:  \n  - *“hierarchical society”* (Abstract; Sec. I: *“common ancestor… had a hierarchical social structure”*; Sec. VI: *“resurgence [of hierarchy] was due to convergent evolution”*)  \n  - *“hierarchical social structure”*, *“hierarchical-broken symmetry state”*, *“hierarchical phase”*, *“hierarchical structures”*, *“hierarchical order parameter H”*, *“hierarchical perception”*  \n- Explicitly contrasted with egalitarian in the *“U-shaped trajectory”* (Knauft’s model) and the *“egalitarian-hierarchical spectrum”*.  \n- Associated with large group size and high ecological pressure.\n\n✅ **‘Cooperative’**:  \n- Appears **5 times**, but **never as a societal type descriptor** (i.e., no “cooperative society”).  \n- Always used adjectivally to describe *relations*, *behavior*, or *capacity*:  \n  - *“capacity to cooperate and form coalitions”* (Sec. II)  \n  - *“cooperative behavior”* (Sec. VI: *“altruistic genes and the emergence of the ‘do unto others’ ideas… in the symmetric phase”* — implied cooperative ethos)  \n  - *“cooperation”* appears 3× (e.g., *“coalitions or the antagonism”*, *“collaboration”* in Sec. VI), reinforcing relational—not typological—usage.\n\n✅ **‘Competitive’**:  \n- Appears **4 times**, again **never as a societal label**.  \n- Used exclusively in the phrase *“competition between…”*:  \n  - *“competition between cognitive and social constraints”* (Title, Abstract, Sec. I, Sec. V)  \n  - *“competition of cognitive and social navigation needs”* (Sec. VI)  \n- Refers to *tension between internal constraints on cognition and external demands of social navigation*, not inter-societal rivalry or competitive social systems.\n\n❌ **Absent terms** (zero occurrences):  \n- *centralized*, *decentralized*, *static*, *adaptive*, *top-down*, *bottom-up*  \n- Verified via full-text search of PDF/OCR-equivalent string content (including headers, captions, references, appendix). None appear even once — not as nouns, adjectives, or compounds.\n\n🔍 **Important nuance**: While the model implies decentralization in egalitarian phases (symmetric, distributed degrees) and centralization in hierarchical ones (star topology, “central agent”), the paper **avoids those terms** — instead using *“symmetric/broken symmetry”*, *“star topology”*, *“central position”*, or *“central agent”*. Likewise, though it discusses adaptation to ecology and demography, it never uses *“adaptive society”* — preferring *“response to ecological pressure”*, *“modulated by environmental pressure”*, or *“phase transition”*.\n\n---\n\n**3. Additional Context on the document and question asked**  \n\nThis is a theoretical physics–informed anthropology paper published as a preprint (arXiv:1807.03630), applying statistical mechanics and information theory to model the *perceived social network* of individuals within groups. Its core innovation is framing social hierarchy not as a fixed cultural trait, but as an *emergent property* of constrained cognition (memory limits) and social navigation demands (inferring relationships indirectly), modulated by group size (*n*) and ecological pressure (*β*). The “phase transition” metaphor — borrowed from thermodynamics — is central: just as water freezes or boils at critical thresholds of temperature/pressure, societies shift between egalitarian (symmetric) and hierarchical (asymmetric) *perceptual states* when parameters like *z = 2α/n(n−1)* cross critical values.\n\nThe question asks for *societal descriptors* — i.e., lexical items that classify or typologize whole societies. The paper’s theoretical framework deliberately avoids normative or structural labels like *centralized/decentralized* (which imply institutional design) or *top-down/bottom-up* (which imply governance directionality). Instead, it grounds description in *cognitive representation*: hierarchy emerges from *asymmetry in perceived centrality* (degree distribution), not formal authority. Thus, while the model *implies* decentralization in egalitarian phases, it describes it as *“symmetric phase”* or *“full graph”*, not “decentralized society”.\n\nAlso notable: The paper treats *“egalitarian”* and *“hierarchical”* not as binary opposites but as ends of a *continuous spectrum*, quantified by the order parameter *H = 2(1 − IE(davg)/IE(dmax))* (Fig. 2, 3). This allows for an *intermediate “Big Man” regime* — fluid, non-institutionalized inequality — further underscoring that these terms are used as *graded, empirically measurable properties*, not rigid categories.\n\nFinally, the repeated pairing of *“egalitarian-hierarchical”* (12×) signals that these are the paper’s foundational, co-defined poles — a deliberate terminological choice aligning with anthropological literature (e.g., Knauft, Boehm) cited throughout. Their dominance reflects the paper’s central thesis: human social structure is best understood through the lens of this dynamic, biocognitively grounded duality.",

Extract the exact terms used.'}':\n1. Short answer  \nThe label words at both ends of each of the three axes in Figure 1 are:  \n- Axis 1 (Standardization vs. Localization): **Standardized** and **Localized**  \n- Axis 2 (Utilitarian vs. Egalitarian): **Utilitarian** and **Egalitarian**  \n- Axis 3 (Consequential vs. Deontological): **Consequential** and **Deontological**  \n\nThese exact terms appear in the caption and labels of Figure 1 (described in Section 7 and visually summarized in the figure’s schematic, explicitly named in the text on p. 12–14 and in the summary on p. 14: “LED end” = Localized, Egalitarian, Deontological; “SUC end” = Standardized, Utilitarian, Consequential).\n\n2. Extremely detailed answer  \nThe question asks for the *exact label words* appearing *at both ends* of *each of the three axes* in **Figure 1**, as presented in the provided document.\n\nWe locate Figure 1 in Section 7 (“Mapping Perspectives”), specifically referenced in subsection 7.3.2 and described in the caption on page 12 (just before the figure) and again in the summary paragraph on page 14:\n\n> “Summary: Based on the pattern of high-level characterizations and common arguments made for, and against, each end of the identiﬁed axes, we place them along a single axis, with one end containing **localized, deontological, egalitarian** approaches (LED) and the other end containing **standardized, utilitarian, consequential** approaches (SUC); we illustrate this mapping in **Figure 1**.” (p. 14)\n\nCrucially, the figure itself is not embedded as an image in the text—but its *labels are fully specified in the surrounding textual description*, and — most definitively — in the **figure caption** printed *immediately above* the figure on page 12:\n\n> **Figure 1**: Three identiﬁed axes along which the debate about regulation of fairness in AI falls; Here they are aligned along **high-level characterizations** and **common arguments made for, and against, each of the ends of the identiﬁed axes**.\n\nThen, on the same page (p. 12), the figure is *visually represented in ASCII-style schematic form* (as is common in plain-text PDFs or arXiv preprints), reproduced here from the document:\n\n```\nStandardized    Localized\nEgalitarian     Utilitarian\nConsequential   Deontological\nSubjective      Hard to deploy\nInclusive       Objective\nEasy to deploy  Majoritarian\n```\n\nHowever — this block is *not* the figure itself, but rather a *textual rendering* of the figure’s layout used for accessibility/printing. The key is that the *first row* corresponds to Axis 1, the *second row* to Axis 2, and the *third row* to Axis 3 — as confirmed by the section structure (7.1, 7.2, 7.3) and the explicit naming in the summary.\n\nLet’s verify each axis using *both structural context and direct textual labeling*:\n\n- **Axis 1: Standardization vs. Localization**  \n  Section 7.1 is titled “Axis-1: Standardization vs. Localization”. Its subsection 7.1.1 defines the axis and states:  \n  > “Standardization entails the process of making things of the same type all have the same basic features… By contrast, localization describes the process of making a product or a service more suitable for a particular country, area, etc.”  \n  In the schematic block, the first line reads:  \n  `Standardized    Localized`  \n  ✅ Exact match — these are the two end-labels.\n\n- **Axis 2: Utilitarian vs. Egalitarian**  \n  Section 7.2 is titled “Axis-2: Utilitarian vs. Egalitarian”. Subsection 7.2.1 states:  \n  > “The second axis of interest addresses diﬀerences between **utilitarian** and **egalitarian** views.”  \n  In the schematic block, the second line reads:  \n  `Egalitarian     Utilitarian`  \n  Note the order is reversed (Egalitarian first, then Utilitarian), but the *terms themselves* are identical and unambiguous. The paper consistently treats them as binary opposites (e.g., “Utilitarianism vs. Egalitarianism” in the Abstract and Section 7 intro). The figure places them at opposite ends — order does not affect label identity.  \n  ✅ Exact terms: **Egalitarian**, **Utilitarian**\n\n- **Axis 3: Consequential vs. Deontological**  \n  Section 7.3 is titled “Axis-3: Consequential vs. Deontological”. Subsection 7.3.1 states:  \n  > “This third axis of interest [...] represents the diﬀerences between **consequential** and **deontological** ethics.”  \n  In the schematic block, the third line reads:  \n  `Consequential   Deontological`  \n  ✅ Exact match — and note the precise orthography: “Consequential” (not “Consequentialist”) and “Deontological” (not “Deontic” or “Duty-based”). These are the exact adjectival forms used throughout the paper (e.g., Abstract: “Consequential vs. Deontological ethics”; Section 6: “consequential and deontological ethics”; Section 7.3.1: “consequential and deontological ethics”).\n\nImportantly, the paper *never uses synonyms or variants* for these labels in describing the axes. All cross-references (Abstract, Introduction, Section 7 summary, figure caption, and schematic) use only these six exact lexical items — capitalized as proper axis descriptors in the schematic, and lowercase when used descriptively in running text (but always the same root words).\n\nThus, the label words at the ends are:\n- Axis 1: **Standardized**, **Localized**  \n- Axis 2: **Utilitarian**, **Egalitarian**  \n- Axis 3: **Consequential**, **Deontological**  \n\n(All extracted verbatim, case-matched to their appearance in the schematic block and section headings.)\n\n3. Additional Context on the document and question asked  \nThis document is an interdisciplinary academic position paper — “Fairness in Agreement With European Values: An Interdisciplinary Perspective on AI Regulation” — authored by 8 scholars across law, computer science, philosophy, and social sciences. It was submitted in July 2022 and engages critically with the European Commission’s 2021 Proposal for an Artificial Intelligence Act.\n\nFigure 1 is a conceptual framework introduced in Section 7 to synthesize divergent disciplinary viewpoints into three fundamental normative tensions. It is *not* an empirical plot or data visualization, but a *heuristic mapping device*: a triaxial schema organizing arguments *for* and *against* positions along philosophical, legal, and practical dimensions.\n\nThe question asks for “label words at both ends of each of the three axes in Figure 1”, and crucially instructs to “extract the exact terms used”. This implies strict fidelity to the text — no paraphrasing, no inferring synonyms (e.g., “standardisation” UK spelling is not used; “deontic” does not appear; “outcome-based” is discussed but never labels the axis). The document deliberately chooses concise, parallel, adjectival English terms — all ending in “-ized”, “-itarian”, “-itarian”, “-al”, “-al”, “-al” — to enable the LED/SUC acronym mnemonic (p. 14), reinforcing that these six words are the canonical, author-intended labels.\n\nThe presence of the schematic block (`Standardized Localized`, etc.) — though typographically rudimentary — functions *as the figure* in this plain-text version. Its inclusion immediately after the figure caption and before the prose discussion confirms it is the authoritative representation of Figure 1’s labeling. No ambiguity arises from missing graphics: the labels are fully specified in-text and unambiguously assigned to axes via section numbering and definitional passages.\n\nHence, the answer is grounded entirely in the document’s own self-referential, internally consistent terminology — making extraction unambiguous and objective.\n\nResults for tool call 'inspect_file_as_text' with arguments '{'file_path': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.03637.pdf', 'question': \"What words in this paper describe types of society? Specifically, does it use any of the following as societal descriptors: 'egalitarian', 'hierarchical', 'centralized', 'decentralized', 'static', 'adaptive', 'top-down', 'bottom-up', 'cooperative', 'competitive'? And in what context — e.g., 'egalitarian society' or 'hierarchical society'?\"}':\n**1. Short answer**  \nYes — the paper explicitly and repeatedly uses **‘egalitarian’** and **‘hierarchical’** as core societal descriptors, always in the context of *types of society*: e.g., *“egalitarian society”*, *“hierarchical society”*, *“transition from egalitarian to hierarchical societies”*. It also uses **‘cooperative’** (e.g., *“capacity to cooperate”*, *“cooperative behavior”*) and **‘competitive’** (e.g., *“competition between cognitive and social constraints”*, *“competition between cognitive constraints and social navigation needs”*) — but **not** as direct *societal type labels* (i.e., not “competitive society” or “cooperative society”). The remaining terms — *centralized, decentralized, static, adaptive, top-down, bottom-up* — **do not appear at all** in the text.\n\n---\n\n**2. Extremely detailed answer**  \n\nThe paper systematically employs sociological terminology to characterize macro-level social organization, with precise, theory-anchored usage:\n\n✅ **‘Egalitarian’**:  \n- Appears **34 times**, almost exclusively modifying *society*, *structure*, *organization*, or *phase*.  \n- Key phrases:  \n  - *“egalitarian society”* (e.g., Abstract: *“Phase transition from egalitarian to hierarchical societies”*; Sec. I: *“Paleolithic humans… most likely had a largely egalitarian society”*)  \n  - *“egalitarian structures”*, *“egalitarian-symmetric state”*, *“egalitarian phase”*, *“egalitarian organization”*, *“egalitarian perception”*, *“egalitarian-hierarchical spectrum”*  \n- Used both descriptively (*“modern hunter-gatherers in mild climates a trend towards an intermediate hierarchy degree”*) and theoretically (*“symmetric phase”*, *“unbroken symmetry phase”* — Fig. 3 caption).  \n- Strongly tied to cognitive capacity (encephalization) and small group size.\n\n✅ **‘Hierarchical’**:  \n- Appears **47 times**, equally central and consistently paired with *society*, *structure*, *order*, *phase*, or *organization*.  \n- Key phrases:  \n  - *“hierarchical society”* (Abstract; Sec. I: *“common ancestor… had a hierarchical social structure”*; Sec. VI: *“resurgence [of hierarchy] was due to convergent evolution”*)  \n  - *“hierarchical social structure”*, *“hierarchical-broken symmetry state”*, *“hierarchical phase”*, *“hierarchical structures”*, *“hierarchical order parameter H”*, *“hierarchical perception”*  \n- Explicitly contrasted with egalitarian in the *“U-shaped trajectory”* (Knauft’s model) and the *“egalitarian-hierarchical spectrum”*.  \n- Associated with large group size and high ecological pressure.\n\n✅ **‘Cooperative’**:  \n- Appears **5 times**, but **never as a societal type descriptor** (i.e., no “cooperative society”).  \n- Always used adjectivally to describe *relations*, *behavior*, or *capacity*:  \n  - *“capacity to cooperate and form coalitions”* (Sec. II)  \n  - *“cooperative behavior”* (Sec. VI: *“altruistic genes and the emergence of the ‘do unto others’ ideas… in the symmetric phase”* — implied cooperative ethos)  \n  - *“cooperation”* appears 3× (e.g., *“coalitions or the antagonism”*, *“collaboration”* in Sec. VI), reinforcing relational—not typological—usage.\n\n✅ **‘Competitive’**:  \n- Appears **4 times**, again **never as a societal label**.  \n- Used exclusively in the phrase *“competition between…”*:  \n  - *“competition between cognitive and social constraints”* (Title, Abstract, Sec. I, Sec. V)  \n  - *“competition of cognitive and social navigation needs”* (Sec. VI)  \n- Refers to *tension between internal constraints on cognition and external demands of social navigation*, not inter-societal rivalry or competitive social systems.\n\n❌ **Absent terms** (zero occurrences):  \n- *centralized*, *decentralized*, *static*, *adaptive*, *top-down*, *bottom-up*  \n- Verified via full-text search of PDF/OCR-equivalent string content (including headers, captions, references, appendix). None appear even once — not as nouns, adjectives, or compounds.\n\n🔍 **Important nuance**: While the model implies decentralization in egalitarian phases (symmetric, distributed degrees) and centralization in hierarchical ones (star topology, “central agent”), the paper **avoids those terms** — instead using *“symmetric/broken symmetry”*, *“star topology”*, *“central position”*, or *“central agent”*. Likewise, though it discusses adaptation to ecology and demography, it never uses *“adaptive society”* — preferring *“response to ecological pressure”*, *“modulated by environmental pressure”*, or *“phase transition”*.\n\n---\n\n**3. Additional Context on the document and question asked**  \n\nThis is a theoretical physics–informed anthropology paper published as a preprint (arXiv:1807.03630), applying statistical mechanics and information theory to model the *perceived social network* of individuals within groups. Its core innovation is framing social hierarchy not as a fixed cultural trait, but as an *emergent property* of constrained cognition (memory limits) and social navigation demands (inferring relationships indirectly), modulated by group size (*n*) and ecological pressure (*β*). The “phase transition” metaphor — borrowed from thermodynamics — is central: just as water freezes or boils at critical thresholds of temperature/pressure, societies shift between egalitarian (symmetric) and hierarchical (asymmetric) *perceptual states* when parameters like *z = 2α/n(n−1)* cross critical values.\n\nThe question asks for *societal descriptors* — i.e., lexical items that classify or typologize whole societies. The paper’s theoretical framework deliberately avoids normative or structural labels like *centralized/decentralized* (which imply institutional design) or *top-down/bottom-up* (which imply governance directionality). Instead, it grounds description in *cognitive representation*: hierarchy emerges from *asymmetry in perceived centrality* (degree distribution), not formal authority. Thus, while the model *implies* decentralization in egalitarian phases, it describes it as *“symmetric phase”* or *“full graph”*, not “decentralized society”.\n\nAlso notable: The paper treats *“egalitarian”* and *“hierarchical”* not as binary opposites but as ends of a *continuous spectrum*, quantified by the order parameter *H = 2(1 − IE(davg)/IE(dmax))* (Fig. 2, 3). This allows for an *intermediate “Big Man” regime* — fluid, non-institutionalized inequality — further underscoring that these terms are used as *graded, empirically measurable properties*, not rigid categories.\n\nFinally, the repeated pairing of *“egalitarian-hierarchical”* (12×) signals that these are the paper’s foundational, co-defined poles — a deliberate terminological choice aligning with anthropological literature (e.g., Knauft, Boehm) cited throughout. Their dominance reflects the paper’s central thesis: human social structure is best understood through the lens of this dynamic, biocognitively grounded duality."
